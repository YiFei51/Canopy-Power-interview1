hello

Here is the process for data cleaning.

1. I reorganised the timestamp for the data set
2. I used filter function to sort out the "null" value and changed to zero
3. I used MAX(0, number) to filter out the negative value
4. Total diesel needed is 10,024 litres

I had attached the graph I had plotted.
